# -IBM-s-2-000-DJI-Tello-Drone-Giveaway
DJI Tello drones can be controlled using their official SDK, and you can interact with them using Python.
Controlling the DJI Tello Drone with Python

If your goal is to interact with the DJI Tello drone, for example to control it or to automate tasks, here is an example Python code using the djitellopy library, which simplifies controlling the drone via Python.
1. Install Required Libraries

First, youâ€™ll need to install djitellopy, which is a Python library that interfaces with the DJI Tello drone.

pip install djitellopy

2. Python Code to Control the DJI Tello Drone

Here is a simple Python script that connects to the DJI Tello drone and allows you to perform basic movements.

from djitellopy import Tello
import time

# Initialize the Tello drone object
tello = Tello()

# Connect to the drone
tello.connect()

# Print the battery status
print(f"Battery: {tello.get_battery()}%")

# Takeoff the drone
tello.takeoff()

# Perform a simple movement (for example, move up)
tello.move_up(50)  # Move up by 50 cm

# Rotate 90 degrees to the right
tello.rotate_clockwise(90)

# Fly forward 100 cm
tello.move_forward(100)

# Take a picture (optional)
tello.take_picture()

# Land the drone
tello.land()

# Disconnect
tello.end()

print("Flight completed!")

Key Functions Used:

    tello.connect(): Connects to the drone.
    tello.takeoff(): Takes off the drone.
    tello.move_up(), tello.move_forward(), etc.: Moves the drone in specific directions.
    tello.rotate_clockwise(): Rotates the drone.
    tello.take_picture(): Takes a picture (if supported).
    tello.land(): Lands the drone.
    tello.end(): Ends the connection to the drone.

3. Running the Code

Once you have the djitellopy library installed and the script written, make sure the Tello drone is powered on and connected to your WiFi. When you run the Python script, the drone should execute the commands (take off, move, rotate, etc.).
4. Video Streaming from Tello

If you want to access the video feed from the DJI Tello, you can use the following code snippet:

from djitellopy import Tello
import cv2

# Initialize the Tello drone
tello = Tello()

# Connect to the drone
tello.connect()

# Start video streaming
tello.streamon()

# Capture video frames
while True:
    frame = tello.get_frame_read().frame
    cv2.imshow("Tello Camera Feed", frame)

    # Break the loop when 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Stop video streaming
tello.streamoff()

# Disconnect the drone
tello.end()

# Close all OpenCV windows
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

This will show the live video feed from the drone's camera in a window.
Conclusion

    If you're referring to a specific giveaway event by IBM, it's best to follow the promotional guidelines provided by IBM to participate.
    If you're looking to interact with a DJI Tello drone, you can use the djitellopy library in Python to control the drone, capture images, and even stream video.
